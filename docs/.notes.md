# Ungradeable Contracts

Thunder Loan is implemented using upgradeable contracts via the proxy pattern:
- logic is in the implementation contract(s)
- storage is in the proxy contract(s)

In this pattern, implementation contract(s) will not have constructors. Instead, they have initialization functions that the proxy contract(s) will call. NOTE: these initialization functions MUST BE CALLED before the contracts are accessed by users or other externals.
